# Number Guessing Game in C++

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **simple number guessing game** implemented in **C++**.  
It demonstrates basic **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts using four main entities:

- **Guesser**
- **Three Players**
- **Umpire**

The goal is to check which player(s) guess the same number as the Guesser.

3. **Umpire**

   - Collects guesses from all three players.
   - Compares the guesses.
   - Declares the winner(s) who matched the Guesser’s number.
